# Final project - It can sound like a party, privacy - frontend
The main purpose was to build a platform for a choreographic sound artwork to be sent in real time to two users that connect to the site.
The users will receive different audiofiles and voice instructions. 

## This app has been generated using `create-react-app`. 
1. Clone the new repo to your computer
2. Install required dependencies with npm: `npm install`
3. Start the project: `npm start`

## Reflections
We planned that the frontend should be build upon two different panels, one for the user and one for the admin. The admin will have access to adding and deleting sound files stored in the database. 
We specified the pages, endpoints and styling and split the tasks up into week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4.

If we had more time, what would be next?
> If we had more time we would experiment with a completely different user flow. For example a bigger room with 8 people to start off the session and only after that divide the users into pairs (A, B) (C, D) (E, F), and into smaller rooms. The soundstream would only start when all the users has been divided.
> A chat function where people who are in the same room could chat with each other before the session starts, and after when the session has ended. 
> On the last page we would add a feedback-button to a page where the users can post feedback to us about the platform, as well as about the experience itself :)
> Create PWA that would enable users to at least see the page without the need for WiFi as well as making it downloadable.
